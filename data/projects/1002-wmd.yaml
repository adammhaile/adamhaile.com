description: This wasn't so much a commission as it was a challenge. After building Colossus, a friend who heads up [WyoLum](http://wyolum.com) asked me what I thought I could do with a bunch of their [8x16 LED panels](https://www.seeedstudio.com/TiM-p-1516.html). I jokingly responded that if I had 24 of them I could build a 64x48 pixel display and show low res video on it. Needless to say, a box arrived at my door not long after. This remains one of the highest resolution displays I've ever built (with this type of LED) and was yet another serious project. Also one of my favorite builds ever, but I marked it "1 of 1" and I'm sticking to it. As seen on [HackADay.com](https://hackaday.com/2016/03/12/how-many-leds-are-too-many/).
