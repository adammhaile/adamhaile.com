description: Some projects start with a simple idea and explode from there. In this case, it was using a billiard ball as a trackball in a computer mouse. And that led me down the road to a completely custom, and gigantic, trackball mouse built around an old Atari arcade trackball assembly. It's as usable as it is ridiculous, so I'll call this one a win. As seen on [HackADay.com](https://hackaday.com/2019/01/25/billiard-ball-finds-a-new-home-in-custom-trackball-mouse/).
