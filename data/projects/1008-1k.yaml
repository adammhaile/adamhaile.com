description: One of my earlier projects after getting into 3D printing, it mostly consists of making a really nice case for a bunch of existing hardware. Probably one of the first complex assemblies I've ever designed in CAD... and that was because when I used simple tools like 123D Design. But hey, it still looks awesome and keeps a place on honor on my shelf.
